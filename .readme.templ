== When to write an ADR

We use this repository in a few ways:

 1. Design specifications where a single document captures everything about a feature, examples are ADR-8, ADR-32, ADR-37 and ADR-40
 1. Guidance on conventions and design such as ADR-6 which documents all the valid naming rules
 1. Capturing design that might impact many areas of the system such as ADR-2

We want to move away from using these to document individual minor decisions, moving instead to spec like documents that are living documents and can change over time. Each capturing revisions and history.

== Template

Please see the [template](adr-template.md). The template body is a guideline. Feel free to add sections as you feel appropriate. Look at the other ADRs for examples. However the initial Table of metadata and header format is required to match.
